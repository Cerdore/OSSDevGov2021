# Chapter 22 Large-Scale Changes

**Written by Hyrum Wright**
**Edited by Lisa Carey**

Think for a moment about your own codebase. How many files can you reliably update in a single, simultaneous commit? What are the factors that constrain that number? Have you ever tried committing a change that large? Would you be able to do it in a reasonable amount of time in an emergency? How does your largest commit size compare to the actual size of your codebase? How would you test such a change? How many people would need to review the change before it is committed? Would you be able to roll back that change if it did get committed? The answers to these questions might surprise you (both what you think the answers are and what they actually turn out to be for your organization).

At Google, we've long ago abandoned the idea of making sweeping changes across our codebase in these types of large atomic changes. Our observation has been that, as a codebase and the number of engineers working in it grows, the largest atomic change possible counterintuitively decreases running all affected presubmit checks and tests becomes difficult, to say nothing of even ensuring that every file in the change is up to date before submission. As it has become more difficult to make sweeping changes to our codebase, given our general desire to be able to continually improve underlying infrastructure, we've had to develop new ways of reasoning about large-scale changes and how to implement them.

In this chapter, we'll talk about the techniques, both social and technical, that enable us to keep the large Google codebase flexible and responsive to changes in underlying infrastructure. We'll also provide some real-life examples of how and where we've used these approaches. Although your codebase might not look like Google's, under standing these principles and adapting them locally will help your development orga nization scale while still being able to make broad changes across your codebase.

## What Is a Large-Scale Change?

Before going much further, we should dig into what qualifies as a large-scale change (LSC).In our experience, an LSC is any set of changes that are logically related but cannot practically be submitted as a single atomic unit. This might be because it touches so many files that the underlying tooling can't commit them all at once, or it might be because the change is so large that it would always have merge conflicts. In many cases, an LSC is dictated by your repository topology: if your organization uses a collection of distributed or federated repositories, making atomic changes across them might not even be technically possible. We'll look at potential barriers to atomic changes in more detail later in this chapter. 

LSCs at Google are almost always generated using automated tooling. Reasons for making an LSC vary, but the changes themselves generally fall into a few basic categories:

+ Cleaning up common antipatterns using codebase-wide analysis tooling
+ Replacing uses of deprecated library features
+ Enabling low-level infrastructure improvements, such as compiler upgrades
+ Moving users from an old system to a newer one ^3

The number of engineers working on these specific tasks in a given organization might be low, but it is useful for their customers to have insight into the LSC tools and process. By their very nature, LSCs will affect a large number of customers, and the LSC tools easily scale down to teams making only a few dozen related changes.

There can be broader motivating causes behind specific LSCs. For example, a new language standard might introduce a more efficient idiom for accomplishing a given task, an internal library interface might change, or a new compiler release might require fixing existing problems that would be flagged as errors by the new release. The majority of LSCs across Google actually have near-zero functional impact: they tend to be widespread textual updates for clarity, optimization, or future compatibility. But LSCs are not theoretically limited to this behavior-preserving/refactoring class of change.

In all of these cases, on a codebase the size of Google's, infrastructure teams might routinely need to change hundreds of thousands of individual references to the old pattern or symbol. In the largest cases so far, we've touched millions of references, and we expect the process to continue to scale well. Generally, we've found it advantageous to invest early and often in tooling to enable LSCs for the many teams doing infrastructure work. We've also found that efficient tooling also helps engineers per forming smaller changes. The same tools that make changing thousands of files efficient also scale down to tens of files reasonably well.

## Who Deals with LSCs?

As just indicated, the infrastructure teams that build and manage our systems are responsible for much of the work of performing LSCs, but the tools and resources are available across the company. If you skipped Chapter 1, you might wonder why infra structure teams are the ones responsible for this work. Why can't we just introduce a new class, function, or system and dictate that everybody who uses the old one move to the updated analogue? Although this might seem easier in practice, it turns out not to scale very well for several reasons.

First, the infrastructure teams that build and manage the underlying systems are also the ones with the domain knowledge required to fix the hundreds of thousands of references to them. Teams that consume the infrastructure are unlikely to have the context for handling many of these migrations, and it is globally inefficient to expect them to each relearn expertise that infrastructure teams already have. Centralization also allows for faster recovery when faced with errors because errors generally fall into a small set of categories, and the team running the migration can have a play book formal or informal for addressing them.

Consider the amount of time it takes to do the first of a series of semi-mechanical changes that you don't understand. You probably spend some time reading about the motivation and nature of the change, find an easy example, try to follow the provided suggestions, and then try to apply that to your local code. Repeating this for every team in an organization greatly increases the overall cost of execution. By making only a few centralized teams responsible for LSCs, Google both internalizes those costs and drives them down by making it possible for the change to happen more efficiently.

Second, nobody likes unfunded mandates. Even though a new system might be categorically better than the one it replaces, those benefits are often diffused across an organization and thus unlikely to matter enough for individual teams to want to update on their own initiative. If the new system is important enough to migrate to, the costs of migration will be borne somewhere in the organization. Centralizing the migration and accounting for its costs is almost always faster and cheaper than depending on individual teams to organically migrate.

Additionally, having teams that own the systems requiring LSCs helps align incentives to ensure the change gets done. In our experience, organic migrations are unlikely to fully succeed, in part because engineers tend to use existing code as exam ples when writing new code. Having a team that has a vested interest in removing the old system responsible for the migration effort helps ensure that it actually gets done. Although funding and staffing a team to run these kinds of migrations can seem like an additional cost, it is actually just internalizing the externalities that an unfunded mandate creates, with the additional benefits of economies of scale.

Much like transportation infrastructure tasks consist of building new roads as well as repairing old ones, infrastructure groups at Google spend a lot of time fixing existing code, in addition to developing new systems and moving users to them.

Aptly named the Google Template Library, this library consisted of several header files' worth of implementation. For reasons lost in the mists of time, one of these header files was named stl_util.h and another was named map-util.h (note the different separators in the file names).In addition to driving the consistency purists nuts, this difference also led to reduced productivity, and engineers had to remember which file used which separator, and only discovered when they got it wrong after a potentially lengthy compile cycle.

Library authors could find and apply this change en masse without having to bother end users of these files, and we were able to quantitatively reduce the number of build failures caused by this specific issue. The resulting increases in productivity (and happiness) more than paid for the time to make the change.

## Barriers to Atomic Changes

Before we discuss the process that Google uses to actually effect LSCs, we should talk about why many kinds of changes can't be committed atomically. In an ideal world, all logical changes could be packaged into a single atomic commit that could be tes ted, reviewed, and committed independent of other changes. Unfortunately, as a repository--and the number of engineers working in it--grows, that ideal becomes less feasible. It can be completely infeasible even at small scale when using a set of distributed or federated repositories.

### Technical Limitations

To begin with, most Version Control Systems (VCSs) have operations that scale line arly with the size of a change. Your system might be able to handle small commits (e.g., on the order of tens of files) just fine, but might not have sufficient memory or processing power to atomically commit thousands of files at once. In centralized VCSs, commits can block other writers (and in older systems, readers) from using the system as they process, meaning that large commits stall other users of the system.

In short, it might not be just "difficult" or "unwise" to make a large change atomically: it might simply be impossible with a given infrastructure. Splitting the large change into smaller, independent chunks gets around these limitations, although it makes the execution of the change more complex.

### Merge Conflicts

As the size of a change grows, the potential for merge conflicts also increases. Every version control system we know of requires updating and merging, potentially with manual resolution, if a newer version of a file exists in the central repository. As the number of files in a change increases, the probability of encountering a merge con flict also grows and  is compounded by the number of engineers working in the repository.

If your company is small, you might be able to sneak in a change that touches every file in the repository on a weekend when nobody is doing development. Or you might have an informal system of grabbing the global repository lock by passing a virtual (or even physical!) token around your development team. At a large, global company like Google, these approaches are just not feasible: somebody is always making changes to the repository.

With few files in a change, the probability of merge conflicts shrinks, so they are more likely to be committed without problems. This property also holds for the following areas as well.

### No Haunted Graveyards

The SREs who run Google's production services have a mantra: "No Haunted Graveyards." A haunted graveyard in this sense is a system that is so ancient, obtuse, or complex that no one dares enter it. Haunted graveyards are often business-critical systems that are frozen in time because any attempt to change them could cause the system to fail in incomprehensible ways, costing the business real money. They pose a real existential risk and can consume an inordinate amount of resources.

Haunted graveyards don't just exist in production systems, however; they can be found in codebases. Many organizations have bits of software that are old and unmaintained, written by someone long off the team, and on the critical path of some important revenue-generating functionality. These systems are also frozen in time, with layers of bureaucracy built up to prevent changes that might cause instability. Nobody wants to be the network support engineer II who flipped the wrong bit!

These parts of a codebase are anathema to the LSC process because they prevent the completion of large migrations, the decommissioning of other systems upon which they rely, or the upgrade of compilers or libraries that they use. From an LSC perspective, haunted graveyards prevent all kinds of meaningful progress.

At Google, we've found the counter to this to be good, ol'-fashioned testing. When software is thoroughly tested, we can make arbitrary changes to it and know with confidence whether those changes are breaking, no matter the age or complexity of the system. Writing those tests takes a lot of effort, but it allows a codebase like Google's to evolve over long periods of time, consigning the notion of haunted software graveyards to a graveyard of its own.

### Heterogeneity

LSCs really work only when the bulk of the effort for them can be done by computers, not humans. As good as humans can be with ambiguity, computers rely upon consistent environments to apply the proper code transformations to the correct places. If your organization has many different VCSs, Continuous Integration (CI) systems, project-specific tooling, or formatting guidelines, it is difficult to make sweeping changes across your entire codebase. Simplifying the environment to add more consistency will help both the humans who need to move around in it and the robots making automated transformations.

For example, many projects at Google have presubmit tests configured to run before changes are made to their codebase. Those checks can be very complex, ranging from checking new dependencies against a whitelist, to running tests, to ensuring that the change has an associated bug. Many of these checks are relevant for teams writing new features, but for LSCs, they just add additional irrelevant complexity.

We've decided to embrace some of this complexity, such as running presubmit tests, by making it standard across our codebase. For other inconsistencies, we advise teams to omit their special checks when parts of LSCs touch their project code. Most teams are happy to help given the benefit these kinds of changes are to their projects.
